# ENGR-103H-Final

The game that I made for this project is reaction-based, where you press buttons that correspond to both the color of a random light, and what side of the light it is on. When you start the code, you are on the pause menu. If you press either button, you can change the difficulty from easy to hard. Easy mode makes the game slower, and hard mode makes the game faster. The mode that you are on is given in the serial monitor to the player. To exit pause mode, flick the lever at the bottom to the left. If it has started on the left, flick it to the right, and back to the left again. The game starts immediately, and a random light will light up. It will either be green or red. If it is green, press the button on the same side of the light. If it is red, press the button on the opposite side of the light. The game goes on at the same speed until you fail. Once you fail (which occurs when yoiu press the wrong button, when you press no buttons, or when you press both buttons) you will return you to paused mode. Your score will be given to the player in the serial monitor. You can start the game again by flicking the switch back and forth.
